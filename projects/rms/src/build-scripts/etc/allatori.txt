Stack trace
-----------

java -cp <path to allatori.jar> com.allatori.StackTrace allatori-log.xml <file with obfuscated stack trace> <output file>

Rebuild allatori-log.xml
------------------------

Individual log.xml files are built under common/pf, client/pf, etc.
allatori-log.xml is a sort of combination of these.  It's used to
define ahead of time the obfuscated names so that we don't get name
collisions between the different jars (we are odd in that we have
things in the same package, but in different jars.  If these are
obfuscated separately then two different classes in different jars in
the same package can end up with the same name.  This is a very bad
thing.

java -jar <location of allatori> allatori-config.xml

Then copy new-allatori-log.xml over allatori-log.xml
