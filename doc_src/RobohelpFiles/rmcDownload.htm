<h4>Downloading the Rights Management Client</h4>
<p>Rights Management Client (RMC) allows you to protect and classify documents. &#160;RMC enforces your companyâ€™s information governance policies based on your user credentials. These include not only user attributes but also the classification labels attached to documents, and environmental context (such as which computer the user is</p>
<p>logged on from).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In the Rights Management Client, with the appropriate rights the user can view not only a rights protected document but also print, edit, and taking screen shots of the document.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
